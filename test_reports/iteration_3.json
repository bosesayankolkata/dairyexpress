Possible explanations:\n1. Issue was already resolved\n2. User may be using different credentials\n3. Browser cache/cookie issues on user's end\n4. User may be testing a different environment\n\nRecommendation: Ask user to clear browser cache/cookies and try again, or provide specific error details they're experiencing.",
